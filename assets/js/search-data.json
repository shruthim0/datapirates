The simulation is an abstraction and therefore cannot contain any bias., 2. The simulation may accidentally contain bias due to the exclusion of details., 3. If the simulation is found to contain bias, then it is not possible to remove the bias from the simulation., 4.The only way for the simulation to be biased is if the researcher intentionally used data that favored their desired output.&quot;) if Q1 == &quot;3&quot;: print(&quot;GREAT JOB!&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(Q1 + &quot; is incorrect!&quot;) Q2 = input(&quot;Jack is trying to plan his financial future using an online tool.

For each scenario chosen, the tool does some calculations and outputs his projected savings at the ages of 35, 45, and 55.Would that be considered a simulation and why?&quot;) print(&quot;Here are your choices: 1.No, it&#39;s not a simulation because it does not include a visualization of the results., 2. No, it&#39;s not a simulation because it does not include all the details of his life history and the future financial environment., 3. Yes, it&#39;s a simulation because it runs on a computer and includes both user input and computed output., 4.

Realistic sound effects based on the material of the baseball bat and the velocity of the hit, 2. A depiction of an audience in the stands with lifelike behavior in response to hit accuracy, 3.

She creates a computer simulation of the parachute opening at different heights and in different environmental conditions.What are advantages of running the simulation versus an actual experiment?&quot;) # NOTE: THERE ARE TWO POSSIBLE ANSWERS print(&quot;Here are your choices: 1. The simulation will not contain any bias that favors one body type over another, while an experiment will be biased., 2. The simulation can be run more safely than an actual experiment, 3. The simulation will accurately predict the parachute&#39;s safety level, while an experiment may be inaccurate due to faulty experimental design., 4.
